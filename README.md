# PhD_thesis
This repository contains datasets and Python scripts that were used in the thesis **"Applied machine learning for the analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems"**.

In the thesis, I present results in the section 3:

3.1 Automated interference of CRISPRi guide efficiency in bacteria from genome-wide essentiality screens

3.2 Analysis of CRISPR-Cas genome-wide screens

3.2.1 Analysis of CRISPR base editor genome-wide screen in Escherichia coli
3.2.2 Analysis of CRISPR-Cas13a genome-wide screen in Escherichia coli
3.2.3 Analysis of CRISPR-Cas12a genome-wide screen in Klebsiella pneumoniae

In this repository, there are **FOUR** folders:
* **CRISPRi** for result *3.1*
* **CRISPR_base_editor** for result *3.2.1*
* **Cas13a** for result *3.2.2*
* **Cas12a** for result *3.2.3*
